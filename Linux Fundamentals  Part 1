# tryhackme-cybersecurity-write-ups
Hi, I'm Emma
I'm transitioning to cybersecurity from a successful decade-long career as a hairstylist.
This repo documents my hands on learning journey through [Tryhackme] (https://tryhackme.com), and other labs.
Each write-up shows the steps I took, the tools I used and the lessons I learned.
